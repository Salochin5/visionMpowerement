visionMpowerement scripts

Lets create our folder first where everything will be stored.
We'll be using command line interface and show what is exactly happening in graphical user experience

mkdir visionMpowerement

That was a code which was basically called whenever you create a new folder through right click, new folder and then you rename your folder.

Lets start by learning a few of other commands.
A commonly used command is:
 ls
listing all the content inside the folder.

you might want to create a new file where you store commands and scripts.
 touch index.html

Then lets create an images folder.
 mkdir images

What if you want to get into the folder? Who has an idea of what we could do?
  yeah, cd images.
Then another folder inside the images called logos.

while you want to get back, what do you do?
 cd ../

 And to see what folder we are in.
  pwd

Now you have a grasp of what happens when you use a mouse and anything else that is called by a function?
We shall not cover alot of commands on this lesson, but you can do a little bit of searching to know more of them.
But before we continue, the assignment is to find out how 

Lets get in the visual studio, I shall not explain most of the things at this video since I know you have a basic understanding of html and css.
We might create a video of it as soon as we are ready.


    <title>visionMpowerement</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

Oops, we forgot to create the file
 touch styles.css

I'm also going to be using font awesome which is a jascript file you can find in: 
I'll put the link in the script file so you can access, but basically you can just search on google like we did
 https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.1.1/css/all.min.css" integrity="sha512-KfkfwYDsLkIlwQp6LFnl8zNdLGxu9YAA1QvwINks4PhcElQSvqcyVLLD9aMhXd13uQjoXtEKNosOWaZqXgel0g==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" />


Comment Navbar
Navbar - holds the logo which is just a h1 tag and the navigation. We can put anythig else later if we wish to.

wrap it with a container div, then in that.
<div class="container"></div>

h1 with class logo and our logo name visionMpowerement
Then navigation with nav tag
then ul for unordered list and then we list our items. This could be any you want users to access as fast as they want.

    <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="features.html">Features</a></li>
    <li><a href="docs.html">Docs</a></li>

live server extension for reloading purposes.

Some specific fonts for my theme.
search google fonts. 
https://fonts.google.com/
styles.css -> roboto : @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap');
<style>
    * {
        /* //on every element by default */
        /* // This helps us place borders and stuff without adding width of the eleement */
        box-sizing: border-box;
        padding: 0;
        margin: 0
    }

    body {
        font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
        color: #333;
        line-height: 1.6
    }
    ul {
        list-style-type: none;
    }
    a {
        text-decoration: none;
        color: #333
    }
</style>
















































Anytime you click and functions are called, that is the work of javascript which we shall not cover this time.
